**Project Overview: Weather Forecast Application**

The Weather Forecast Application is a user-friendly web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather data for any city entered by the user. It displays essential weather information such as city, temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed, providing users with a quick, accessible way to stay informed about current weather conditions.
